### Note

‚ö†Ô∏è The theme for this slide is **heavily customised** for Tania's use. So use with caution, there is some docs about the themes, palettes and basic customisation. 
The slides were modified from reveal.js but are fully responsive when it comes to slides, fonts and image resizing 'cause you know this was driving me crazy.

If you need help modifying things let me know (Tania ü¶Ñ)
